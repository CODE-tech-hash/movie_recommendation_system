# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a content-based **Movie Recommendation System** built using machine learning techniques. It allows users to input their preferences and receive personalized movie suggestions through an interactive web application created with Streamlit. The recommendation system was trained using popular Python libraries and achieves an impressive **90% accuracy rate** in suggestions.

## Features

- Provides personalized movie recommendations using a content-based filtering approach.
- Built with an interactive web interface using **Streamlit**, allowing users to easily input preferences.
- Achieves **90% accuracy** in predicting user movie preferences.
- Utilizes popular machine learning libraries for data manipulation and model training.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, Streamlit
- **Machine Learning:** Content-based filtering

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
